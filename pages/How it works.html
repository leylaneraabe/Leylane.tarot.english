        <br>The origin of the cards in the traditional deck is uncertain. Neither can it be stated with total certainty, since there are several versions of this story, if the set of 22 major trumps or Arcana - with their emblematic designs - and the very well known 56 letters of the so-called Minor Arcana - with their four suits - were created separately and later combined into a single deck, or if, since birth took the form of a deck of seventy-eight cards.<br>
        It seems that the 56 cards in the common deck were copied from the game widespread among Mameluke warriors. The authors of the addition of the 22 letters so called "major arcana" among tarot experts remain unknown.<br /> </p>

      <p>
        The twenty-two paths connects to the ten spheres and it represents the Major arcana of the Tarot cards, it can also be used for meditation and self-knowledge by itself or combined. The adjustment of these energies unifies the whole and the one <br /> In this way the twenty-two paths are a search, they are the awareness of man of all his actions, are the representation of the intellectual and spiritual stages, are the flowers of the road that we can harvest only some or all of them. In the Bible, it is no accident that we have twenty-two chapters in the Book of Revelations. Somehow everything is interconnected and both give us the same lesson from different perspectives. Therefore, the twenty-two chapters of the Book of Revelations are numerically linked to the twenty and two spiritual paths of the Tarot. <br />

      <h3 class="expectation">What to expect from a reading?</h3>

      <p>
        <br />
        When we experience difficult times in our lives, it is not always simple to organize the thoughts in our heads and understand exactly where is the problem or where are we going wrong. <br />
        <br /> At this moment we use a Tarot reader to “throw” us a light, however, it is not always able to pass all the answers in the best way if you don't give him some kind of direction. The function of the tarot reader is to interpret the cards and give direction and not to guess. So, here are some tips for you to get the best of a Tarot reading, because one of the great secrets is that the tarot captures your energy and turns it into symbolism to be decoded by the tarot, being thus the clarity and objectivity in what is asked, since the cards will answer exactly what was requested in this sense, if the question is confusing or double-meaning, the answer also will be and I guess that at this moment what you need most and clear answers that will actually help you. <br />

      <p class="questions">If you are too confuse and don't know where to start</p>
      <p class="answers">

      </p>

      <p class="questions">Do not mix questions</p>
      <p class="answers">

      </p>

      <p class="questions">
        Ask exactly what you want to know 
      </p>

      <p class="answers">

Thus, two readings will be made, one for each path, for that you can decide better or instead of receiving an answer definitive that the Tarot cannot give; More important than knowing whether a relationship will work out or not, is <b> whether it’s worth it</b>. After all, you can even be with someone, but that is no guarantee of happiness;
