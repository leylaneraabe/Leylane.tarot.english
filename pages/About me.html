      <br>  Fate has several paths and among these you came here, surely this has a special reason! <br>
            At a very young age tarot cards became a big passion to me and over 10 years I have been giving help for hundreds of people through the knowledge of wicca religion the wisdom of tarot. <br>
            <br> The study that gives a solid foundation to my readings is the esoteric cabala, based on the tree of life.Some years ago I have started my studies also in the gipsy grandma's deck, an oracle that I have an immense affection, which was created by a gipsy family from south of Brazil. <br>
            <br> I see my tarot cards as a gift that was given by my dear mentors to be able to bring some light to people's lives, my goal is in fact help everybody who comes in search for answers to see the reality more clearly and make better choices, achieve goals and have a better point of view of what happen their path in order to find hapiness.
            <br> <br>
            I am always clear and straight foward as possible in my readings, I'm here to hear and understand you without judgments. </br>
            Come find the missing answers to give your next step towards your dream! Don't give up just yet! </p>
